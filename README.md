Sheba.ai 🧠🌍
Empowering Local Languages through AI | Building Inclusive Technology for Africa

🚀 About Sheba.ai
Sheba.ai is an AI-powered initiative born in the Horn of Africa. It is dedicated to breaking language and technological barriers through inclusive, ethical, and community-driven innovation. We build cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition, and Machine Learning tools tailored for East African languages, starting with underrepresented languages such as Amharic, Swahili, Tigrinya, Afaan Oromoo, and Somali.

Sheba.ai isn’t just a tech company. It’s a mission-driven movement to democratize access to AI and digital tools for marginalized communities by embracing ancestral wisdom and futuristic innovation.

🎯 Mission
To develop and deploy AI tools that empower local languages, enhance digital inclusion, and unlock socio-economic opportunities for millions across East Africa.

🌍 Vision
A world where African communities have equal access to digital infrastructure, powered by AI that understands and speaks their language.

🧩 What We’re Building
Multilingual NLP Models
Custom-trained models for local language understanding, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

Speech-to-Text & Voice Assistants
Tools to recognize and process local dialects, enabling voice-based interaction for accessibility and inclusion.

Data Collection Pipelines
Ethical, community-led data sourcing initiatives to build high-quality datasets for under-resourced languages.

AI-Powered Education & Health Solutions
Intelligent platforms and bots to assist in education delivery, mental health support, and civic engagement.

Open Source Language Infrastructure
